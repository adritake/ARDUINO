# PIANO.INO
I was bored and I made this program to play the piano with a remote controller, an infrared receiver and a buzzer. I had to use this [library](https://bitbucket.org/teckel12/arduino-new-tone/src)
because the default tone libray uses the same timer as the IRremote library. It is possible to use any kind of remote controller with IR emitter
but you need to know the values of the infrared signal. You can know that by simply running the program and checking what values appear
on the console.
